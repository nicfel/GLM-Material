# Inference of predictor contributions from phylogenetic trees
Folder contains the materials to recreate the material of the simulation part of the results section

## Constant
Material for the comparison between DTA-GLM and MASCOT-GLM based on time invariant predictors (Figure 2).

## PhylogeneticUncertainty
Material for the testing of the performance of the MASCOT-GLM model and comparing the inference when inferring and when fixing the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1).
